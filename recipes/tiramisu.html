        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An Italian dessert that takes coffee, cream, and cookies to the next level. This will require some refridgeration time to firm up, so make it in the morning or early afternoon for a nice evening sweet treat. Ciao!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Heavy cream (2 cups)</li>

            <li>Add coffee to a shallow bowl and dip the Biscoff cookies in one at a time (no need to soak, just well dipped). Be sure to coat both sides.</li>

            <li>Add another layer of dipped Biscoff cookies followed by spreading the remaining marscarpone mixture evenly ontop.</li>
            <li>Dus the tiramisu with cocoa powder using a fine-mesh strainer or sifter.</li>
            <li>Refridgerate for at least four hours or overnight before serving.</li>
